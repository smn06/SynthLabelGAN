## SynthLabelGAN: GANs for Improved Data Labeling in RL

### Overview

SynthLabelGAN is a powerful tool that leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to revolutionize data labeling in Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks. By generating synthetic data for labeling, this project aims to enhance the efficiency of data collection and annotation processes, ultimately improving the training of RL models.
